            <h1>Late 1980s–Early 1990s: The Origins of C#</h1>
1988:<br>
Microsoft launched C++/CLI (C++ with Managed Extensions), which laid the groundwork for a new programming language<br>
 designed to work with the .NET framework.<br>
1990s:<br>
Microsoft sought a successor to C++ that would be simpler, more secure, and better suited for rapid software development.<br>
 This led to the conceptualization of C#.<br>

<h1>2000: C# Development Begins</h1>
2000:<br>
C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg, a prominent Danish software engineer who previously worked on Turbo Pascal and Delphi.<br>
 C# was created as part of the .NET initiative, a Microsoft platform for building and running applications. It was designed to be<br>
  simple, modern, and object-oriented, combining the best features of languages like C++, Java, and Visual Basic.<br>
C# was initially meant to be a component of the .NET Framework, which aimed to simplify the development of Windows applications<br>
 with a focus on object-oriented design.<br>

<h1>2002: C# 1.0 Released</h1>
2002:<br>
The first official version of C# was released along with .NET Framework 1.0. C# 1.0 introduced essential features such as:<br>
Classes and objects<br>
Inheritance and polymorphism<br>
Basic exception handling<br>
Garbage collection<br>
At this time, C# was intended primarily for Windows-based applications, but it had a clear design aiming at a wider future<br>
 in cross-platform development.<br>

<h1>2005: C# 2.0 and LINQ</h1>
November 2005:<br>
C# 2.0 was released alongside .NET Framework 2.0. New features included:<br>
Generics for stronger typing and code reuse<br>
Anonymous methods for inline code logic<br>
Nullable types for handling value types with null values<br>

<h1>2007: C# 3.0 and Language-Integrated Query (LINQ)</h1>
November 2007:<br>
C# 3.0 was released with significant updates, including:<br>
Language-Integrated Query (LINQ), which allowed developers to write SQL-like queries directly in C# for better data manipulation<br>
Anonymous types<br>
Extension methods<br>
Automatic properties<br>
Implicitly typed variables (var)<br>
LINQ revolutionized how data was queried, making C# a more powerful language for working with databases and collections.<br>

<h1>2010: C# 4.0 and Dynamic Language Runtime</h1>
April 2010:<br>
C# 4.0 was released with key improvements, including:<br>
Dynamic typing via the dynamic keyword, allowing C# to interact with dynamic languages such as Python and JavaScript<br>
Named and optional arguments for method calls<br>
Interop improvements for COM (Component Object Model) and inter-language communication<br>

<h1>2012: C# 5.0 and Asynchronous Programming</h1>
August 2012:<br>
C# 5.0 was released with the introduction of asynchronous programming features:<br>
async and await keywords, making it easier to write asynchronous code<br>
Improvements in error handling and debugging<br>
C# 5.0’s asynchronous programming model laid the foundation for modern, high-performance applications,<br>
 especially those requiring responsiveness and scalability.<br>

<h1>2015: C# 6.0 and Simplification</h1>
July 2015:<br>
C# 6.0 was released alongside .NET Framework 4.6. New features focused on simplifying code and improving readability:<br>
Expression-bodied members for more concise syntax<br>
Interpolated strings for easier string formatting<br>
Null-conditional operators (?.) to avoid null reference exceptions<br>
C# 6.0 made the language even more elegant and developer-friendly while maintaining backward compatibility.<br>

<h1>2017: C# 7.0 and Enhanced Performance</h1>
March 2017:<br>
C# 7.0 was released with a focus on performance improvements and new features:<br>
Tuples for grouping multiple values in a single object<br>
Local functions for defining methods inside other methods<br>
Pattern matching improvements<br>

<h1>2020: C# 9.0 and Record Types</h1>
November 2020:<br>
C# 9.0 introduced significant updates:<br>
Record types for immutable data models<br>
Init-only properties<br>
Top-level statements for simplifying program entry points<br>
Improved pattern matching<br>
Record types were a major addition, simplifying the creation of immutable objects with value-based equality.<br>

<h1>2021: C# 10.0 and .NET 6</h1>
November 2021:<br>
C# 10.0 was released with the launch of .NET 6, focusing on improving the developer experience:<br>
Global using directives<br>
File-scoped namespaces<br>
Improved lambda expressions<br>
Enhancements in pattern matching<br>
C# 10 and .NET 6 continued the trend of improved productivity and performance, with emphasis on reducing<br>
 boilerplate code and improving language features.<br><br><br><br>


C# continues to be one of the most popular and versatile programming languages,<br>
 used in web development (via ASP.NET), mobile applications (via Xamarin), and game development (via Unity).<br>
  It remains a central part of the .NET ecosystem and continues evolving with each new version,<br>
   improving developer productivity and supporting modern technologies like cloud computing, AI, and machine learning.<br>
As of today, C# is recognized for its balance of performance, safety, and ease of use, and it is widely adopted across<br>
 industries for building enterprise-grade applications.<br>
